            <p>Iâ€™m a developer passionate about creating modern user interfaces and solving problems through successful digital products.</p>
        <p className=''>I'm currently a 4th-year student at ICCT - Main Campus, aspiring to become a full-stack developer. My primary expertise lies in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), and I'm always eager to explore new technologies.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy watching courses on Udemy and practicing modern web design using Figma and Adobe XD to refine my UI/UX skills.</p>
        <p>Currently, Iâ€™m working on a project focused on local AI integration using Ollama, combining Flask and React to build intelligent applications.
